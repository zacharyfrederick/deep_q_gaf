# deep_q_gaf

This is an implementation of a automated trading strategy based on DeepMind's Atari paper. Rather than frames the agent observes pricing data (OHLC) encodes as images using Gramian Angular Fields. Shows some promise but ultimately the market is largely efficient in short timescales. Better to use fundamental data and longer timespans.
