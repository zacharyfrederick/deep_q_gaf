# deep_q_gaf

This is an implementation of a automated trading strategy based on DeepMind's Atari paper. Rather than frames the agent observes pricing data (OHLC) encoded as images using Gramian Angular Fields concatenated together based on a multiresnet structure from a paper on identifying cancerous moles from images. Shows some promise but ultimately the market is largely efficient in short timeframes. Better to use fundamental data and longer timespans.
